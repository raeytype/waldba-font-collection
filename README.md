# The Waldba Font Collection

The goal of the Waldba project is to help preserve the *digital typography heritage* of Ge'ez (Ethiopic) script.
Preservation is accomplished by migrating computer fonts, primarily outline fonts, to OpenType format under Unicode
encoding.  The computer fonts to preserve, in turn, are those that are no longer actively maintained by their creators.
Where the creator may have moved on to other projects, might be a company that has been defunct for decades, or an
individual who has passed away.  The initial focus are fonts of the 1990s and those of released under an open source license.

The intial fonts in migrated under the Waldba project come from WashRa collection of the [Senamirmir Project](https://senamirmir.org/).


**About the name:** just as the original font collection was named after the Washera Mariam monestary, this collection is named after reknowned another monetary of Ethiopian.
[ዋልድባ /  Waldba](http://www.iueotcff.org/waldba/about) is situated in northern Ethiopia that has faced unprecedented challenges for its survival in in recent years.


## Background
The Educational Fontware company developed a collection of 14 fonts that illustrate the sequence and direction of written strokes needed to form the Geʾez letters. The collection was developed over a two year period and generously released in 2011 under the [Open Font License](OFL.txt) (OFL). The motivation behind developing the font collection was for use in Ethiopia and Eritrea elementary school education.  The collection was provided to the respective governments, however, the extent of their utilization is unknown.

The "Zelan" typeface was originally created by the Senamirmir Project and distributed as part of the WashRa font collection.  The ዘላን font is a continuation of Zelan since its last update by the Senamirmir Project in 2008 in the WashRa 4.1 release. 


## Goals
The goal of this project is to extend the fonts with the Ethiopic letters that have been added to the Unicode Standard since the release of the original collection.  
continuation of Zelan since its last update by the Senamirmir Project in 2008 in the WashRa 4.1 release. 
Under this goal, the primary focus of the project is to add the letters needed to support the writing practices of living languages that use the Ethiopic (Geʾez) script such at Blin and Gurage.
